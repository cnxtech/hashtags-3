# HashTags

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/mwat56/go-hashtags?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/mwat56/go-hashtags)

## Purpose

Sometimes one might want to search and find socalled `#hashtags` or `@mentions` in your texts (in a broader sense) and store them for later retrieval.
This package offers that facility.
It provides the `THashList` class which can be used to parse texts for the occurance of both `#hashtags` and `@mentions` and store the hits in an internal list for later lookup; that list can be both stored in a file and later read from a file.

## Installation

You can use `Go` to install this package for you:

    go get -u github.com/mwat56/go-hashtags

## Usage

In principle for each `#hashtag` (or `@mention`) a list of IDs is maintained.
These IDs can be any (string) data that identifies the text in which the `#hashtag` was found, e.g. a filename or some database record reference.
The only condition is that it is unique as far as the program using this package is concerned.
